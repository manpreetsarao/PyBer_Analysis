# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
In this project, we analyzed data from two data source. First is city data file and second is ride data file. The first step of our analysis is to merge these two data sets for further analysis. After that we calculate the total fare for each city type between a date range.
The purpose of this new analysis is to analyze the data in more detail with date frames. As earlier, in module we did all analysis on city type but in new project we consider the months. The new analysis gives us more elaborated details for each city type with dates. To see how each city type is performing during a particular month we divided our date data into weeks. 
## Results
From the Summary data frame, we can predict that total rides, total drivers and total fares are high for urban city type as compared to the suburban and rural city type. But the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are high for rural city type the reason of this is longer rides.

From the figure we can clearly see that city type has great impact on total fare.   As urban city type has the highest fare and rural city has lowest total fare and suburban city type lies in the middle. Total fare is dependent upon the number of rides and number of rides directly dependent on city type. As the urban cities are more populated than the other two types that the reason of the highest total fare. The other thing that we can see that there are some weeks of month in which total fare is increasing   parallelly. As in the fourth week of  February total fare for each city is high.

## Sumary
-	The first recommendation could be to increase the number of available drivers for rural and suburban type in the end of February.
-	To add incentives for drivers in urban areas for completing a greater number of trips.
-	To increase the minimum fare price in urban areas to help raise earning per ride for drivers.
